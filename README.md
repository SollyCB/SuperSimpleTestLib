# A Super Simple (but imo clean) Test Library

I was getting annoyed by Gtest, as it was annoying to set it up while using custom allocators, 
and the work required to maintain a test main file made me want to make something simpler. 

I liked Gtest while I could just link the lib in cmake, but a custom main file is wayyy too much 
work...
